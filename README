Docspedition

What:   An all-in-one Documentation scraping utility

Why:    It's easy to get caught up in what you think needs to be written,
        ignoring what is already available at your fingertips.

Contributions welcome!

Goals:

    - More docset spiders
    - Central control script (docsped)
        -u Update cache
        -e Edit user config (Possibly a better interface for this?)
            User config would define:
                Docsets the user is interested in
                Granularity of fetches (modules vs individual methods)
                Operating Systems to suggest/ignore
        -g Get result of new query
        -m (Mark element as completed?)
        -i (Mark element as ignored?)
